# Description
Designer Data is a Ruby on Rails web application for creating custom visual graphics. Users can upload their own .tsv files into the app and choose various graph types to display that data. They can share the graph they create on Twitter.

# Goals
In future releases, we will be able to upload .csv, json and xml files to create the graphs and share them on multiple social media outlets like Facebook and G+. We will also have the ability to embed graphs into your website using a widget.
